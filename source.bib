	abstract = {The development of lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices over the past decade has attracted growing interest. LOC devices aim to achieve the miniaturization, integration, automation and parallelization of biological and chemical assays. One of the applications, the ability to effectively and accurately manipulate and separate micro- and nano-scale particles in an aqueous solution, is particularly appealing in biological, chemical and medical ﬁelds. Among the technologies that have been developed and implemented in microﬂuidic microsystems for particle manipulation and separation (such as mechanical, inertial, hydrodynamic, acoustic, optical, magnetic and electrical methodologies), dielectrophoresis (DEP) may prove to be the most popular because of its label-free nature, ability to manipulate neutral bioparticles, analyse with high selectivity and sensitivity, compatibility with LOC devices, and easy and direct interface with electronics. The required spatial electric non-uniformities for the DEP effect can be generated by patterning microelectrode arrays within microchannels, or placing insulating obstacles within a microchannel and curving the microchannels. A wide variety of electrode- and insulator-based DEP microdevices have been developed, fabricated, and successfully employed to manipulate and separate bioparticles (i.e. DNA, proteins, bacteria, viruses, mammalian and yeast cells). This review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of microfabrication techniques and of the structures of dielectrophoretic microdevices aimed towards different applications. The techniques used for particle manipulation and separation based on microﬂuidics are provided in this paper. In addition, we also present the theoretical background of DEP.},

They are widely used in lab-on-chip devices for the manipulation, trapping, separation, and characterization of cells, microorganisms, and other particles. The DEP force and ROT torque depend on the respective polarizabilities of the particle and medium, which in turn depend on their dielectric properties and on the ﬁeld frequency. In this work, we present a new software, MyDEP, which implements several particle models based on concentric shells with adjustable dielectric properties. This tool enables the study of the variation in DEP and ROT spectra according to different parameters, such as the ﬁeld frequency and medium conductivity. Such predictions of particle behavior are very useful for choosing appropriate parameters in DEP experiments. The software also enables the study of the homogenized properties of spherical or ellipsoidal multishell particles and provides a database containing published cell properties. Equivalent electrical conductivity and relative permittivity of the cell alone and in suspension can be calculated. The software also offers the ability to create graphs of the evolution of the crossover frequencies with the electric ﬁeld frequency. These graphs can be directly exported from the software.},

The ac electric ﬁelds induce movement of polarizable particles, a phenomenon known as dielectrophoresis. The high strength electric ﬁelds that are often used in separation systems can give rise to ﬂuid motion, which in turn results in a viscous drag on the particle. The electric ﬁeld generates heat, leading to volume forces in the liquid. Gradients in conductivity and permittivity give rise to electrothermal forces and gradients in mass density to buoyancy. In addition, non-uniform ac electric ﬁelds produce forces on the induced charges in the diffuse double layer on the electrodes. This causes a steady ﬂuid motion termed ac electro-osmosis. The effects of Brownian motion are also discussed in this context. The orders of magnitude of the various forces experienced by a particle in a model microelectrode system are estimated.},

          , 
            We have built a toolbox of modules for droplet-based microfluidic operations on femtolitre volume droplets. We have demonstrated monodisperse production, sorting, coalescence, splitting, mixing, off-chip incubation and re-injection at high frequencies (up to 3 kHz). We describe the constraints and limitations under which satisfactory performances are obtained, and discuss the physics that controls each operation. For some operations, such as internal mixing, we obtained outstanding performances: for instance, in 75 fL droplets the mixing time was 45 μs, 35-fold faster than previously reported for a droplet microreactor. In practice, in all cases, a level of control comparable to nanolitre or picolitre droplet manipulation was obtained despite the 3 to 6 order of magnitude reduction in droplet volume. Remarkably, all the operations were performed using devices made using standard soft-lithography techniques and PDMS rapid prototyping. We show that femtolitre droplets can be used as microreactors for molecular biology with volumes one billion times smaller than conventional microtitre plate wells: in particular, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was shown to work efficiently in 20 fL droplets.},

In this work, we present the fabrication and integration of a new type of microﬂuidic chip that can provide such tools. With the use of photopatternable silicones, two levels of metal deposited electrodes are sandwiching a microchannel layer, whom height is precisely control. The microfabrication process does not require extra etching step for eventual residual layer, thus making electrical contact between the ﬂuid in the channel and electrodes on the upper and lower slices. The chip is integrated in an experimental bench that addresses up to 120 electrodes immerged and aligned into the channel itself. This high level of integration makes colloidal handling with dielectrophoresis possible thanks to the introduction of several key functions such as focus, defocus, stop or vectorial path. Finally, ﬁrst results are presented with the quantiﬁcation of the inﬂuences of the applied potential frequency and peak-to-peak voltage for the stop function with 1 lm polystyrene colloids under a 600 ll/min ﬂow, highlighting optimal frequency for this function.},

	abstract = {Over the last century a number of techniques have been developed which allow the measurement of the dielectric properties of biological particles in ﬂuid suspension. The majority of these techniques are limited by the fact that they only provide an average value for the dielectric properties of a collection of particles. More recently, with the advent of microfabrication techniques and the Lab-on-a-chip, it has been possible to perform dielectric spectroscopic experiments on single biological particles suspended in physiological media. In this paper we review current methods for single cell dielectric spectroscopy. We also discuss alternative single cell dielectric measurement techniques, speciﬁcally the ac electrokinetic methods of dielectrophoresis and electrorotation. Single cell electrical impedance spectroscopy is also discussed with relevance to a microfabricated ﬂow cytometer. We compare impedance spectroscopy data obtained from measurements made using a microfabricated ﬂow cytometer with simulation data obtained using an equivalent circuit model for the device.},

	abstract = {Among all particle separation approaches, dielectrophoresis actuators which use electric properties difference between particles, have turned into strong separating tools. This way, the particles in the ﬂuid within non-uniform electric ﬁeld experience the dielectrophoresis force. The amount and direction of this force depend on the ﬂuid and particle polarization, particle size and electric ﬁeld gradient. In this paper after presenting governing equations concerning the dielectrophoresis phenomenon, a microﬂuidic actuator introduced in which an interdigitated electrode pattern is applied in. Voltage, pitch, and width to pitch ratio of electrode as well as channel height are of the most important geometrical parameters of this actuator whose individual effect on particles separation was investigated using ﬁnite element analysis (FEM). The simulation results showed that if the actuator is intended to work in the efﬁcient conditions, channel height and electrodes pitch should be near to each other, height needs to be as minimum as possible while voltage as maximum as possible in order to reach to the least time duration and the highest quantity for particles separation. Then, using theoretical equations and simulation results, a ﬂowchart is introduced to design and optimize dielectrophoresis separation actuators. Finally, experimental results for k562 cell separation, as a biological particle, from Polystyrene, as a standard particle, is presented. In the fabricated actuator recovery and purity efﬁciency are 93\% and about 100\% respectively.},

In soft lithography, an elastomeric stamp with patterned relief structures on its surface is used to generate patterns and structures with feature sizes ranging from 30 nm to 100 µm. Five techniques have been demonstrated: microcontact printing (µCP), replica molding (REM), microtransfer molding (µTM), micromolding in capillaries (MIMIC), and solvent-assisted micromolding (SAMIM).

We compared the labelling mechanism, uptake efﬁciency and biocompatibility with 14 different cell types, including adult cells, progenitor cells, immune cells and tumour cells.

            Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) is a promising single-cell analysis technology that is able to identify and isolate individual cells of targeted type, state or environment from an isogenic population or complex consortium of cells, in a label-free and non-invasive manner. However, compared with those widely used yet labeling-required or staining-dependent cell sorting technologies such as FACS and MACS, the weak Raman signal greatly limits the further development of the existing RACS systems to achieve higher throughput. Strategies that can tackle this bottleneck include, first, improvement of Raman-acquisition efficiency and quality based on advanced Raman spectrometers and enhanced Raman techniques; second, development of novel microfluidic devices for cell sorting followed by integration into a complete RACS system. Exploiting these strategies, prototypes for a new generation of RACS have been demonstrated, such as flow-based OT-RACS, DEP-RACS, and SERS/CARS flow cytometry. Such high-throughput microfluidic RACS can provide biologists with a powerful single-cell analysis tool to explore the scientific questions or applications that have been beyond the reach of FACS and MACS.},

We have developed a new non-destructive on-chip cell sorting system for single cell based cultivation, by exploiting the advantage of microfluidics and electrostatic force. The system consists of the following two parts: a cell sorting chip made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on a 0.2-mm-thick glass slide, and an image analysis system with a phasecontrast/fluorescence microscope. The unique features of our system include (i) identification of a target from sample cells is achieved by comparison of the 0.2-µm-resolution phase-contrast and fluorescence images of cells in the microchannel every 1/30 s; (ii) non-destructive sorting of target cells in a laminar flow by application of electrostatic repulsion force for removing unrequited cells from the one laminar flow to the other; (iii) the use of agar gel for electrodes in order to minimize the effect on cells by electrochemical reactions of electrodes, and (iv) pre-filter, which was fabricated within the channel for removal of dust contained in a sample solution from tissue extracts. The sorting chip is capable of continuous operation and we have purified more than ten thousand cells for cultivation without damaging them. Our design has proved to be very efficient and suitable for the routine use in cell purification experiments.},

	abstract = {Rare CTC clusters can be purified intact from large blood volumes with a continuous three-stage non-equilibrium inertial separation array (NISA).
          , 
            Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are extremely rare in the blood, yet they account for metastasis. Notably, it was reported that CTC clusters (CTCCs) can be 50–100 times more metastatic than single CTCs, making them particularly salient as a liquid biopsy target. Yet they can split apart and are even rarer, complicating their recovery. Isolation by filtration risks loss when clusters squeeze through filter pores over time, and release of captured clusters can be difficult. Deterministic lateral displacement is continuous but requires channels not much larger than clusters, leading to clogging. Spiral inertial focusing requires large blood dilution factors (or lysis). Here, we report a microfluidic chip that continuously isolates untouched CTC clusters from large volumes of minimally (or undiluted) whole blood. An array of 100 μm-wide channels first concentrates clusters in the blood, and then a similar array transfers them into a small volume of buffer. The microscope-slide-sized PDMS device isolates individually-spiked CTC clusters from {\textgreater}30 mL per hour of whole blood with 80\% efficiency into enumeration (fluorescence imaging), and on-chip yield approaches 100\% (high speed video). Median blood cell removal (in base-10 logs) is 4.2 for leukocytes, 5.5 for red blood cells, and 4.9 for platelets, leaving less than 0.01\% of leukocytes alongside CTC clusters in the product. We also demonstrate that cluster configurations are preserved. Gentle, high throughput concentration and separation of circulating tumor cell clusters from large blood volumes will enable cluster-specific diagnostics and speed the generation of patient-specific CTC cluster lines.},
